## Introduction

I'm using this readme as a devlog to document the process of building my portfolio website. As such, at the time of writing this introduction, this readme is incomplete and still being added to.

## [Designing With Figma](#table-of-contents)

##### 1/11/2023

I am a big fan of figma, so naturally when I'm building a website I like to sketch out how I want it to look first. This helps me get past things like color selection and general themeing. Today I worked on the landing page and decided on going with a purple theme for the website since it matched the background in my picture.
