## Introduction

Hello! My name is Robert Ireland. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and this is my portfolio.
I'm using this readme as a devlog to document the process of building my portfolio website. As such, at the time of writing this introduction, this readme is incomplete and still being added to.

## [Designing With Figma](#table-of-contents)

##### 1/11/2023

I am a big fan of figma, so naturally when I'm building a website I like to sketch out how I want it to look first. This helps me get past things like color selection and general themeing. Today I worked on the landing page and decided on going with a purple theme for the website since it matched the background in my picture.

## [React With MUI](#table-of-contents)

##### 1/12/2023 

Today I finished my homepage which includes the sidebar. I had done the basic setup stuff before starting this devlog but basically I initialized a new project using npx create-react-app and npm installed material.ui. I prefer using MUI component library. I feel like it's a good balance of functionality and ease of use. The homepage links arent connected yet. I need to look into letting a user pull up a PDF copy of my resume and I need to build another page so I can hook up the links on the sidebar. I'm not worried about setting up the github and linkedin icon links. I also deployed to netlify today without a single issue!

I missed posting yesterday because I was under the weather but I did get some stuff done. Todays post will cover yesterdays changes as well as today. I finished adding in the code for each section and also wrote code to make the scroll animation lock to a certain section. I thought that part would've been harder to figure out but it was actually fairly straightforward. I also designed a couple pages but after looking at it I might change the about page. I'll finish the design for the about section tomorrow.
